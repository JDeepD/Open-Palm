| Features                    |                 Description |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reviewing the code on different test cases | Students can submit code on the default editor and Open-Palm can run it on pre-determined test cases      |
| Maintaining a \*secured interface between Teacher's Page and Editor| It uses username - password based style of entry to the teacher's page|
| Maintaining a responsive database of students | Open-Palm uses local database file to store data of students|

#### Q : What more features does it offer other than evaluating scripts?
#### A : We are working on adding the following features in coming releases :
